Each time they gained a swath of territory on the eastern front, they built a wall to secure it and lined it with landmines. By the time the UN brokered a ceasefire in 1991, six walls had been built.

You’d wake up and see these poor, wretched beings walking by, and sometimes they would cause trouble. Now we don’t have to look over our shoulders at all. For the first time, there’s a real sense of security.\n\n>My grandmother, Anna, came in 1923 and I remember her regaling us with stories about all the good and bad things of life over there.\n\n>The fence, of course, hasn’t stopped us crossing the border.

Often I’ll drive over [via the nearby frontier crossing] to have a meal or coffee with friends.\n\n\nFrosso Petriziki, 42, who works in a pharmacy in the Greek village of Nea Vyssa, often takes the bus over the border for a shopping spree in Edirne.

But what to do when things are so difficult, when there’s so little work and so little money?\n\n>It’s very good that the barrier is there. Before, it was just so frightening. My kids would be out playing at night in the square and there would be all these immigrants just hovering around and they’d be scared to come home.\n\n>Some days I’d open my door in the morning and see 20 people, even women carrying babies, all covered in mud and washing their feet and clothes with the garden hose.\n\n>I’d try to help but then I’d get to the pharmacy and there would be more sitting outside.\n\nNikos Dollis, who owns the Utopia coffee shop in Nea Vyssa, fears the border barrier has helped the business of people smuggling with traffickers now focusing on delivering their human cargo via the river Evros.\n\n>In practice it’s been a huge boost for traffickers. People smugglers from both sides are collaborating even more. A lot of dinghies are being sold in Turkey for next to nothing, we hear, so that traffickers can ferry migrants across the river.\n\n>Before they were mostly economic migrants and were actually very calm.

My grandfather was from the state of Zacatecas and crossed the border to work after the revolution [in Mexico from 1910-20], but was forced back by the depression. My father brought us from Zacatecas to Juárez when I was a baby, and worked in El Paso. Back then it was like one city, there wasn’t even a fence. I would cross all the time over the river to see my aunt and my cousins. We crossed to eat their hamburgers.\n\n>I went as a migrant myself in 1994 just when things were getting tougher. Even then I got a plane from El Paso to Dallas and then to Anchorage, Alaska, with no trouble. I worked packing salmon there, but I’ve also worked in restaurants, car washes, construction and as a gardener.\n\n>The first time I was deported to Tijuana [in Mexico], I returned the next day. It was 1995. The second time I went back through a sewage tunnel into Arizona, but later they blocked that off. The third time I came back to Juárez and jumped the fence. It was 1998.\n\n>Not long after I was picked up and sent to prison for three years for illegal re-entry. They put wetbacks [illegal immigrants] in with hardened criminals and they like putting people in solitary for months. My girlfriend stopped visiting and I don’t know what happened to her. I don’t care either.\n\n>I was deported from prison in December 2002 when they were talking about stopping terrorists crossing. I know the score and won’t try again because I don’t want to be locked up in their jails again. I have some good memories of the US but we have started to hate them because they separated us when we were together. I think they are getting really tough now because of the mafias, but we are the ones who pay the price when all we want to do is work.\n\n>What few jobs there are pay almost nothing and the narcos feed on that. The corruption of the authorities makes it worse, and that is why there has been a war here in Juárez with 15,000 dead. When the soldiers came they picked on people like me because of the way we look. I am covered in scars from the beatings.\n\n>I don’t like my country now. I like theirs less.",

Lee farms in Tongil Village, the only populated area of the demilitarised zone that separates South and North Korea.\n\nDespite farming on North Korea’s doorstep, Lee, 63, like most South Koreans, isn’t much scared by North Korea’s hostile rhetoric. “There are threats all the time,” he says. “It doesn’t bother us. If all of a sudden there were no threats and everything was totally peaceful, that would be strange.” \n\nWhile North Korea’s sabre-rattling doesn’t scare Lee much, the political theatre on the peninsula does have real effects on life in Tongil Village. Earlier this year, when inter-Korean tensions spiked and North Korea cut off access to the jointly operated Kaesong industrial complex, Lee was locked out of his land for three days. In 2010, after an artillery exchange on Yeonpyeong island left four South Koreans dead, Lee was denied entrance for 15 days. All his dogs and chickens starved to death in that time.\n\nWhile there is some apprehension over the possibility of conflict, Tongil Village also has unique benefits.

How dare you think of it?’ So I had to go alone.” \n\nRather than making the short journey south across the demilitarised zone, Oh had to travel all the way to the north, to the border with China.

Based outside São Paulo, it was established in 1978 for a metropolitan elite who wanted sanctuary from inner-city crime. \n\nSince then – and with the extra incentive of low taxes – the gated community has steadily grown and spawned countless imitations. Alphaville now comprises 16 gated compounds, or condominiums, with dozens more on its periphery, plus a surrounding commercial and industrial district. \n\nThe walls vary in size but a typical example is Alphaville 3, which has a 2.5 mile-long (4km-long), whitewashed concrete perimeter structure that rises to a height of 2.5 metres, on top of which sits an electrified and barbed 1.5 metre-high fence. In addition, the 4,000 residents of the Alphaville 3 compound are protected by CCTV and 60 security guards; they are unarmed but can call upon militarised police units stationed nearby. \n\nA rough extrapolation suggests the 60,000-odd residents in the 16 Alphaville condominiums have a total of 40 miles of walls and 960 guards, as well as hefty police backup. Alphaville has now become a franchise, with similar gated communities in cities throughout Brazil, a reflection of a wider global trend that has seen thousands of miles of walls erected between rich and poor neighbourhoods around the world.",

After installing the first such barrier eight years ago, his company, Montag, now maintains the fences for all 16 condominiums and his business is growing alongside the popularity of gated communities.\n\n“Our fences drastically reduce the risk of an intrusion. They can’t be cut, they can’t be toppled and they can’t be scaled. It’s perfect,” he boasts. “And there is no risk to life from the shock. It’s just a deterrent.”\n\nThe drivers for his business are fear and inequality. São Paulo is one of the safest cities in Brazil, and the city’s murder rate fell by more than 70% between 1999 and 2011. But crime remains staggeringly high compared with European or Asian cities. Last year – partly because of a war between police and drug gangs – 4,100 killings were recorded in São Paulo state, a figure that would seem high even in a conflict zone.\n\nAlong with robberies, kidnappings and car thefts, this has added to the unease driving many who can afford it to seek sanctuary.\nResidents are mostly middle-class couples with children. Despite its reputation, Alphaville is not primarily for the super-rich, who are more likely to have their own private, heavily guarded compounds. Instead, it is aimed at business people, doctors, lawyers and expatriates looking to escape the city.\n\n“It’s stressful in São Paulo. People worry about their children and move here so they can provide security for their families,” says 60-year-old Leme, who also lives in a gated community.\n\nMontag can erect 500 metres of fencing in a day. For every 10 metres, it charges 780 reais (£211). Thanks to the prestige of Alphaville, he has won contracts at 80 other compounds.\n\n“These walls have changed my life,” Leme says as we drive along a long road flanked on both sides by whitewashed perimeters. “If you put all of Alphaville together, it is definitely the biggest walled compound in Brazil.”\n\nFinancially, the change has clearly been for the better. But although he himself lives in a gated community and has a made a business from strengthening the security of the walls, he laments the fact they have become necessary.\n\n“When I was a child, society was more equal,” he says. “There was no violence at all. We used to have milk bottles delivered outside our home and no one ever stole them. It was a freer, safer society.”",

She still describes the area in bucolic terms.\n\n“It’s like living in the countryside. Everyone knows everyone. It’s a beautiful place and the education standards of the residents are higher than average,” she says.\n\nThe couple, who run an events management business, initially relocated their offices to Alphaville to exploit its low tax rates. They then moved the family home inside one of the walled compounds. The main motivation, she says, was a higher quality of life and greater security.\n\nThey, like many residents, have had unpleasant experiences with crime on the outside. Figueiredo was held at gunpoint in a restaurant, along with every other diner, and forced to hand over her belongings. Her husband was robbed in his former office when an opportunistic armed thief wandered in and forced everyone to empty their pockets. “He got chicken feed but it was unpleasant, a very strange feeling,” he recalls. “We wanted to live in a simple and safe community. That’s why we moved here. Alphaville has met our expectations.”\n\nThey still have their grumbles. As the population has swollen, so has the traffic and the bank queues, but they are grateful for the protective walls. “When I look at them, I don’t like the fact that I need so much protection,” he says. “But I’m glad they are there. In Brazil, there are too many people who live on the street and carry out robberies. I’m glad I don’t face those risks, and that my children can run around without worrying.”\n\nShe lists the security measures: biometrically controlled entry, photographs of all visitors, high walls, an electrified fence, private guards who are rotated so that they cannot easily plot a break-in.\n\n“In a perfect world, this would not be necessary. Walls add to social divisions, but I’m glad I’m on the right side of them,” says the mother of three.\n\nMost homes appear to have a double garage. Car ownership is high (locals says one for each resident), but the brands are not ostentatious. This is a community of high-end Volkswagens and Toyotas rather than Rolls-Royces and Mercedes Benzes. But several people also have boats on trailers for weekends by the sea.\n\nLargely because of its distant location (the commute to the city centre can be anywhere between 45 minutes and two hours), property prices compare favourably with those in the centre. In Alphaville 3, the average 360 sq metre (3,800 sq ft) property costs 432,000 reais (£117,000), according to the management office.\n\nThe walled condominiums are intended to be self-contained societies with their own parks, beauty salons and club-houses, which offer gyms, yoga classes and tennis courts. Some residents rarely go out except to shop or visit restaurants in the commercial centre of Alphaville.\n\nFigueiredo’s 22-year-old daughter, Fabiana, spent most of her formative years in Alphaville. She recognises that it was a privileged bubble, but wants to move back in after spending several years at university in São Paulo.\n\nFor her, the walls unite as well as divide. In São Paulo, she lives in an apartment block and triple-locks her door. As a result, she has no idea who lives next door.\n\n“In Alphaville, you can at least talk to your neighbour, and we also have a club, a pool, a barbecue area. It’s a life of privilege,” she admits. “Brazil is not safe. If you can afford to come to a place like this, then you come.”\n\nHer mother concurs. “If I were to wake up one morning and find the wall was suddenly gone, my life would totally change. I’d be unhappy and worried because I’d lose the peace of mind that comes from knowing my children can come and go safely. I think I’d look for another compound.”",

        "content": "##Douglas Cunha, Alphaville gardener\n\nFor many of those who live outside the compound walls, Alphaville is geographically close but a world away in terms of social status and living standards.\n\nDouglas Cunha commutes daily between these two very different neighbourhoods. Since 2000, he has worked as a gardener in Tambore 1, one of the newer and more upmarket gated communities that have sprung up on Alphaville’s periphery.\n\nAt 7am each day, he arrives at the compound gates for an identity check, along with hundreds of other gardeners, drivers, housekeepers, labourers and cooks who must register their names, ID numbers and photographs. At 5pm, he is checked out again and makes his way home, across a motorway overpass and up the steep hill to Imperial, a poor area.\n\nAlphaville does not permit favelas (slums) to spring up near its boundaries, but the residents of Imperial live in similar conditions to those in the shantytowns of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Though they overlook and – in the case of Cunha and other staff – help to maintain the manicured lawns and immaculate drives of the gated blocks, the hillside districts have uneven roads, with rubbish strewn across empty plots and graffiti painted on the flaking, whitewashed walls. The ethnic mix is also totally different, with a lot more black faces and a lot fewer white and Asian ones.\n\n“Alphaville is over there; Alfavela is over here,” jokes Cunha. “The rich are inside; the poor are outside. It’s a problem. It’s complicated.”\n\nFor him, the walled community generates work and a little envy. “I like the condominiums. They’re beautiful,” he says. But he is less enthusiastic about the residents, saying: “The people I work for are not very friendly.”\n\nOthers in his community express similarly mixed feelings. Because of its high density of rich residents, Alphaville has some of the highest tax revenues in the country, which means local public schools and hospitals are better funded than most.\n\n“We’ve got a new road now and tapped water, thank God,” says his elderly neighbour, Zenalea Rosa, who has lived in Imperial for 21 years.\n\nBut the trickle-down benefits are uneven, and inequality is glaring. Brazil has made great strides to alleviate poverty over the past decade but there is a long way to go. Cunha says he earns only 400 reais (£108) a month. About half the population of Brazil live on an income below this level, although the minimum wage is supposed to be 674 reais. Crime levels, education standards and health indices are all far lower in communities such as Imperial than in places such as Alphaville. This is one reason for the wave of protests that swept Brazil in June.\n\nSome residents sing the lyrics of a rap song by O Rappa that captures the unease: “The walls of the condominium are supposed to bring protection, but ask yourself whether you are in prison.”  \n\nAlthough there were no demonstrations in Alphaville, the walls are a constant reminder of the sharp divisions that remain.\n\n“This is the richest place in São Paulo, but there is no problem,” said Rosa. “They don’t come here; we don’t go there. We’re just neighbours. That’s all.”",

It reminds me of apartheid. That’s not an exaggeration – though in this case it’s not by race but by social class.” \n\nWhile some residents rarely leave Alphaville, and feel anxious when they do, De Oliveira passes the walls on his way to and from college each day.\n\nTo enter, his identity is checked by fingerprint at the automated barriers, manned by security staff. Visitors must sign in and have their photograph taken. The guards themselves are rotated so frequently that they are never sure where they will be on any given day – a deliberate ploy to prevent them conspiring with thieves or kidnappers.\n\nDe Oliveira acknowledges that such security provides peace of mind. But he cannot wait to get away from what he considers a socially unhealthy and sometimes inconvenient environment.\n\n“When I lived in the city for a few months, I felt liberated because its not natural to live in a condo where you have to drive kilometres to get to the closest store,” he says. He estimates that there is roughly one car for every resident in Alphaville, a claim backed up by the double garages attached to most of the villas.\n\nAn economics student, De Oliveira is optimistic that Brazil is slowly coming to grips with inequality. But he believes the walls highlight the long-standing problems of a nation that was once organised on the basis of elite families and slaves.\n\n“The first thing these walls say is: the government failed to provide security for all of society, so a small percentage provide security for themselves, because violence is one of the major problems in Brazil,” he says. “Secondly, they remind us of income inequality. This is a horrible legacy of Brazil in the 20th century and earlier.” \n\nDe Oliveira says he has never adapted to the culture and mindset of Alphaville. “It’s a place that distances residents from reality. My own parents call the place the Truman Show.”\n\n",

Looming large over the Spanish territory and the border towns of Morocco, the barrier is in fact a fence in three parts, whose purpose is to prevent illegal immigration, and smuggling.\n\nMelilla was part of the Kingdom of Fez until the late 15th century, when Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain ordered the city to be taken. Little could they have known that more than 500 years later it would once again be a battleground between Europe and Africa. In the 20th century, Melilla was used as a staging post for the nationalist uprising led by Francisco Franco in 1936 which began Spain’s civil war and a 40-year dictatorship that cost hundreds of thousands of lives.

        "content": "“Something there is,” runs a line from Robert Frost’s poem Mending Wall, “that doesn’t love a wall.” But for as long as mankind has been building, we have been building walls: around cities, along borders, across disputed lands; to protect, keep out, demarcate and divide.\n\nJericho, on what is now the West Bank, threw up its city walls as early as 8000BC. The Chinese had built long stretches of their Great Wall by 700BC. Hadrian’s Wall, “to separate the Romans from the Barbarians”, came in AD129.\nIn recent times, France misplaced its faith in a supposedly impregnable barrier the length of its frontier with Germany. Three decades later, concrete and barbed wire was slicing Germany’s former capital in half as well.\n\nThe Maginot Line did not work and the Berlin Wall did not last. But the walls and fences have not stopped going up. Indeed, since the Iron Curtain came down a quarter of a century ago, the world has been busy building separation barriers at a rate perhaps unequalled at any point in history: at least 6,000 miles of wire, concrete, steel, sand, stone, mesh, anything to keep peoples out – or in.\n\nIt is not just walls separating divided communities in cities such as Belfast and Homs, or compounds hermetically sealed to divide rich from poor in metropolises such as Sao Paulo. The vast majority of the fencing is going up on borders – and not just around dictatorships or pariah states.\n\nMost strikingly, some of the world’s major democracies including the US, Israel and India have, in the past decade, built thousands of miles of new barriers along borders both recognised and disputed.\n\nSince 2006, the United States has erected 600 miles of fence – some theoretically unscalable, some “virtual”, relying on sensors and cameras – along its border with Mexico. Israel is building a 400-mile barrier around the West Bank, plus another 165-mile fence along its border with Egypt.\n\nIndia has built a 340-mile barrier along the so-called Line of Control of its disputed border with Pakistan, and is busily constructing another 2,500-mile fence on its frontier with Bangladesh. And last year, Greece threw up a four-metre-high wall along its kilometre-long land border with Turkey. The river Evros runs along much of the land frontier.\n\nWhat is odd is that this building is happening at a time when less physical walls appear to be crumbling. This is the age of the global economy, multinationals, vanishing trade barriers; of “the free movement of goods, capital, services and people”, unprecedented mobility and instantaneous communication.\n\nSo why build new walls at such a moment – especially when, as history shows, the old ones rarely did what they set out to do? For there is almost always a way through, under, over or round a wall: as Janet Napolitano, until recently US secretary of homeland security, once astutely observed: “Show me a 50-foot wall, and I’ll show you a 51-foot ladder.”\n\nJames Anderson, emeritus professor of political geography at Queen’s University Belfast, notes that walls get built for very different reasons. “There are those built as a response to internal civil, often ethno-national, conflict, within states and often within cities,” he says.\n\n“There are those erected because two groups are going at each other, but the state itself is not at stake – rich against poor, white against black, criminal against potential victim. And there are those that run along state borders.”\n\nJustified more often than not, these days, as essential anti-terrorist measures, border fences are more likely to be aimed “at keeping out, or at least differentiating, migrant labour”, argues Anderson. He distinguishes, too, between walls that have arisen from what he calls “the bottom up”, and those imposed from the top down.\n\nBelfast’s walls, he notes, originated in 1969 as “simple defence mechanisms, barricades made of bedsteads and doors to stop vehicles coming in to your street”.\n\nThirty years on, they have become “part of people’s reality” and are still – perhaps uniquely in the world of walls – supported by almost all those who live beside them. Running for the most part parallel to the roads into the city centre, though, they are not “huge impediments” to day-to-day life.\n\nThe barrier separating Israel and the West Bank is different. “This was a state project,” says Anderson. “Certainly some, especially the settler movement, welcome it as protection, security against the suicide bombers. Palestinians see it as a mechanism for a land grab.” At times it also causes almost unimaginable inconvenience and hardship.  \n\nWhatever their intended purpose, walls can have unforeseen consequences, says Mick Dumper, professor in Middle East politics at Exeter University. “Israel built the separation barrier to separate two communities and prevent terrorism,” he says.\n\n“One result has been that 60,000-70,000 Palestinians who had moved out of Jerusalem have moved back, because they didn’t want to be cut off from the services they need: at a time when Israel is seeking to assert the city’s Jewish identity, its Palestinian population has sharply increased.”\n\nAnd a wall changes a city, even after it has come down. Wendy Pullan, senior lecturer in the history and philosophy of architecture at Cambridge University, calls this a “disruption of urban order. A divided city changes its whole metabolism. And divided cities do not flourish.”\n\nThe physical reorganisation and reorientation engendered by a wall is accompanied by an inevitable impact on the psychology of those who live beside it, adds Pullan, who heads the Conflict in Cities (CinC) project run by Cambridge University’s centre for urban conflicts research: “There’s a tendency to vilify those on the other side. It’s very easy to say: we can’t see them, we don’t know them, so we don’t like them.”  \n\nBut mainly, walls just don’t do their job very well. “We don’t have examples of walls solving problems,” says Pullan. Suicide bombings may have fallen dramatically since Israel built its wall, “but it’s hard to say whether that’s cause or correlation. The regime has also got much firmer, in other ways.”\nAnderson, also a member of the CinC team, argues that national border fences are at least partly intended for show, for domestic consumption: they are about governments being seen to do something. If the US were truly serious about tackling illegal migrant labour, he says, “it would prosecute more employers”.  \n\nSo in general, concludes Pullan, walls are “more symbolic than anything else. But their symbolism is enormous. Even now, Berlin remains best known for the wall. The most recognisable image of Jerusalem is now, arguably, its wall. The visual impact is so very strong. If you want to get across the idea of division, a wall is very, very powerful.”\n",

We have a well, and I have found young men down there too, but when you talk to them they don’t want help at first, because they are so terrified.\n\n>Everyone has their own story. One time I met a young woman, which is rare, and she told me she did not know what had happened to her baby. I didn’t want to judge her, but I wondered what kind of a mother would make such a dangerous journey with a baby. But I learned that she had been raped on her journey from her home to Spain, resulting in the baby.\n\n>My mother and I try to help as often as we can, giving them clothes, and taking them to the police station, where they register themselves for expulsion. One of the ironies for the sub-Saharan Africans is that in order to stay, they have to register themselves for expulsion, so they can start the paperwork. So we put them in the boot of the car, cover them up, and take them there. \n\n>The Guardia Civil might not want us to, but I don’t care. When you see a person bleeding in front of you, it is very shocking, and you have to help.\nWhen you hear one story, you want to hear all of them. You hear about the terrible fight they have had to endure to get here. It is very stressful, because we live well in this house, and you realise what people do just to get a little freedom.\n\n>The border has also had an effect on my family. My sister and my nephews live in Rabat in Morocco, which means I hardly ever get to see them. They need a visa to get over here, but because my nephews are minors, that’s not so easy. And the last time I went to Morocco, I got caught up in a huge avalanche of people at the border, and the police started hitting me. I asked them to stop, but they carried on hitting me like everyone else.

It was common for both Moroccan and Spaniards to cross and return to their respective homes, making it hard to tell exactly where one country ended and the other began.\n\nBut, as mass immigration from west Africa into Europe took off, calls for a more permanent physical barrier led to the development of the fence that today stands more than six metres tall, with hi-tech sensors, razor wire and 24-hour armed patrol guards. The same situation applies in Spain’s other north African exclave, Ceuta. This is where Fortress Europe meets north Africa.\n\nOn the Moroccan side, the Gurugu mountains have become a staging post for African migrants who want to make their way to Europe. Mostly young men in their 20s and 30s, they hide out in the forests, surviving on whatever scraps of food they can find, with sentry points at various levels for keeping an eye out for Moroccan police.\n\nIn September this year, hundreds of men descended from the mountains to storm the fence, using their great weight of numbers to avoid the Guardia Civil and breach the Spanish defences. Many were arrested, but scores made it over into Melilla, the last leg of a journey that will have seen them cross west and north Africa’s towns and deserts from Cameroon, Senegal, Nigeria and beyond.",

I have many Spanish friends; they liked me, and I was a really hard worker. Sometimes we used to go out to dinner with the family of mye Spanish boss. He treated me like any friend.\n\n>But then in 2009, I was expelled back to Morocco; I still don’t know exactly why. In Morocco I tried to find work, but there is nothing for me there; they pay €6 a day for working in fields, and construction work isn’t much better, but the cost of meat is more expensive than in Spain.\n\n>I got back over the border into Melilla three weeks ago, and have been sleeping in the streets since then. I will go back to mainland Spain however I can, even though now I don’t have the paperwork. I don’t know how long I will be here, or how long it will take, but I will do it. Even though there are fewer jobs in Spain now, it is still better than nothing. I think I will probably go in a boat, but I will have to return to Spain. There is nothing left for me here.\n\n##Fadma Mizian, 65, unemployed mother of six, Nador, Morocco\n\n>I was born in Beni Enzar, in the province of Nador, in 1948. I am a widow and have six children, four girls and two boys, and 13 grandchildren and I have lived all of my life between Morocco and Melilla. During the day I used to go to Melilla to look for work, and when the sun went down, I would come back home to look after my family, make food and try to relax a little in order to prepare myself to return to the fight the following day.\n\n>In the past, there was no difference between Melilla and Beni Enzar: it was all one place, more or less. I used to be able to go into into the Spanish part without any problems, where I worked as a domestic help, cleaning houses, cooking and looking after children. Sometimes I also smuggled stuff across the border to earn a little extra money. My husband and I would buy food and other goods in Melilla, and then cross back into Morocco to sell to shops and businesses.\n\n>Now, the fence stops me from even seeing Melilla, and the border has become more dangerous. It’s much more difficult to enter Melilla, I need to take my passport with me, and there are often huge queues and gatherings of people at the border crossings. Sometimes they don’t let me in, and occasionally the police have hit me because there were too many people, or they wanted to close the border.\n\n>I live with two of my daughters, and four of my grandchildren. My youngest daughter is a single mother and my other daughter has had problems with her husband. I have to keep working in order to support my family, pay the rent, electricity, and buy food and clothes. But at my age that’s very difficult. Before we used to work in Melilla without any paperwork, but now you need the right documents and no one wants to hire an old woman. They only want young girls who have been to school, and who speak good Spanish.\n\n>Therefore I have to work like a donkey, passing goods through Chinatown, one of the neighbourhoods that backs on to the fence. But even that is not what it used to be. Now you have to work a lot, like a slave for big businesses that have lots of money but which pay you next to nothing to carry heavy bales stuffed with goods. That’s not easy for someone like me who is old, and has diabetes and problems with her bones.\n\n",

When there was open access to this street and others in the area there was a real sense of threat. \n\n>Before ‘the Wall’ I remember waiting for a taxi to take me to work one morning, to my cleaning job at the Royal Victoria Hospital in west Belfast. While I was standing in the street, I saw this black cab coming up from Manor Street on the loyalist side and driving around and around the district. I was so frightened about being bundled into it, kidnapped and killed that I went back into the house and arranged for the taxi to pick me up in a safer part of the area. Looking back to that morning makes me shiver, I really think it was a close call. \n\n>I can also recall a young child having glass shoved into his mouth by loyalists on the other side. Before the barrier was reinforced at its base, there was a gap at the bottom of it. The kid was playing on the dead ground by the Wall and he was spotted then trailed underneath the fencing to the other side. \n\n>I have never seen any of my Protestant neighbours over there. The first houses on their side of the Wall are at very least 20 yards away from it. They have created their own buffer zone as well.

Back in the 90s people still had drop bars on the doors to protect them from being smashed in. There wasn’t an open door at night in this area.

It was a crazy, scary place growing up but to be honest it was also exciting. \n\n>Do I think ‘the Wall’ will come down? I’m not sure. Working in this community you find attitudes differ depending on the age group. Older people who lived through the Troubles say never bring them down or at least they don’t think they will come down in their lifetime. I’m sceptical they will too but it’s funny working with kids in their early teens. \n\n>I now do a lot of cross community work with kids from our area and kids from the Lower Oldpark and the Shankill.

I don’t blame them because when I was growing up in that end of the Fountain things were mad. We used to live in a block of flats overlooking Bishop Street and I remember in the 80s the petrol bomb attacks got so bad that one night my parents moved me into a local Salvation Army hostel not far from the estate because it was so dangerous. \n\n>Although it is not as bad as it used to be, there are certain times in the year when the attacks get more intense on the area. Of course, when the marching season is on the summer is always a bad time or when Celtic win and they come up to taunt us about Rangers being in the lower league. \n\n>The people on this estate have clung onto this corner of the city but I don’t think they would stay if the barriers came down especially the ones protecting people’s homes and gardens.

              "$t": "content: ##Clovis Leme, fence contractor\n\nClovis Leme has made a tidy profit from topping Alphaville’s concrete walls with state-of-the-art “concertina” fencing, which includes sensors and electrified cables as well as barbs. After installing the first such barrier eight years ago, his company, Montag, now maintains the fences for all 16 condominiums and his business is growing alongside the popularity of gated communities.\n\n“Our fences drastically reduce the risk of an intrusion. They can’t be cut, they can’t be toppled and they can’t be scaled. It’s perfect,” he boasts. “And there is no risk to life from the shock. It’s just a deterrent.”\n\nThe drivers for his business are fear and inequality. São Paulo is one of the safest cities in Brazil, and the city’s murder rate fell by more than 70% between 1999 and 2011. But crime remains staggeringly high compared with European or Asian cities. Last year – partly because of a war between police and drug gangs – 4,100 killings were recorded in São Paulo state, a figure that would seem high even in a conflict zone.\n\nAlong with robberies, kidnappings and car thefts, this has added to the unease driving many who can afford it to seek sanctuary.\nResidents are mostly middle-class couples with children. Despite its reputation, Alphaville is not primarily for the super-rich, who are more likely to have their own private, heavily guarded compounds. Instead, it is aimed at business people, doctors, lawyers and expatriates looking to escape the city.\n\n“It’s stressful in São Paulo. People worry about their children and move here so they can provide security for their families,” says 60-year-old Leme, who also lives in a gated community.\n\nMontag can erect 500 metres of fencing in a day.

After installing the first such barrier eight years ago, his company, Montag, now maintains the fences for all 16 condominiums and his business is growing alongside the popularity of gated communities.\n\n“Our fences drastically reduce the risk of an intrusion. They can’t be cut, they can’t be toppled and they can’t be scaled. It’s perfect,” he boasts. “And there is no risk to life from the shock. It’s just a deterrent.”\n\nThe drivers for his business are fear and inequality. São Paulo is one of the safest cities in Brazil, and the city’s murder rate fell by more than 70% between 1999 and 2011. But crime remains staggeringly high compared with European or Asian cities. Last year – partly because of a war between police and drug gangs – 4,100 killings were recorded in São Paulo state, a figure that would seem high even in a conflict zone.\n\nAlong with robberies, kidnappings and car thefts, this has added to the unease driving many who can afford it to seek sanctuary.\nResidents are mostly middle-class couples with children. Despite its reputation, Alphaville is not primarily for the super-rich, who are more likely to have their own private, heavily guarded compounds. Instead, it is aimed at business people, doctors, lawyers and expatriates looking to escape the city.\n\n“It’s stressful in São Paulo. People worry about their children and move here so they can provide security for their families,” says 60-year-old Leme, who also lives in a gated community.\n\nMontag can erect 500 metres of fencing in a day. For every 10 metres, it charges 780 reais (£211). Thanks to the prestige of Alphaville, he has won contracts at 80 other compounds.\n\n“These walls have changed my life,” Leme says as we drive along a long road flanked on both sides by whitewashed perimeters. “If you put all of Alphaville together, it is definitely the biggest walled compound in Brazil.”\n\nFinancially, the change has clearly been for the better.

I have got so used to doing that, I sometimes forget when I am outside and do the same thing,” she laughs.\n\nFigueiredo and her husband, Hagop Kassabian, moved into Alphaville 18 years ago, when there were fewer walls, more green fields and a lot less traffic. She still describes the area in bucolic terms.\n\n“It’s like living in the countryside. Everyone knows everyone. It’s a beautiful place and the education standards of the residents are higher than average,” she says.\n\nThe couple, who run an events management business, initially relocated their offices to Alphaville to exploit its low tax rates. They then moved the family home inside one of the walled compounds. The main motivation, she says, was a higher quality of life and greater security.\n\nThey, like many residents, have had unpleasant experiences with crime on the outside. Figueiredo was held at gunpoint in a restaurant, along with every other diner, and forced to hand over her belongings. Her husband was robbed in his former office when an opportunistic armed thief wandered in and forced everyone to empty their pockets. “He got chicken feed but it was unpleasant, a very strange feeling,” he recalls. “We wanted to live in a simple and safe community. That’s why we moved here. Alphaville has met our expectations.”\n\nThey still have their grumbles. As the population has swollen, so has the traffic and the bank queues, but they are grateful for the protective walls. “When I look at them, I don’t like the fact that I need so much protection,” he says. “But I’m glad they are there. In Brazil, there are too many people who live on the street and carry out robberies. I’m glad I don’t face those risks, and that my children can run around without worrying.”\n\nShe lists the security measures: biometrically controlled entry, photographs of all visitors, high walls, an electrified fence, private guards who are rotated so that they cannot easily plot a break-in.\n\n“In a perfect world, this would not be necessary. Walls add to social divisions, but I’m glad I’m on the right side of them,” says the mother of three.\n\nMost homes appear to have a double garage. Car ownership is high (locals says one for each resident), but the brands are not ostentatious. This is a community of high-end Volkswagens and Toyotas rather than Rolls-Royces and Mercedes Benzes. But several people also have boats on trailers for weekends by the sea.\n\nLargely because of its distant location (the commute to the city centre can be anywhere between 45 minutes and two hours), property prices compare favourably with those in the centre. In Alphaville 3, the average 360 sq metre (3,800 sq ft) property costs 432,000 reais (£117,000), according to the management office.\n\nThe walled condominiums are intended to be self-contained societies with their own parks, beauty salons and club-houses, which offer gyms, yoga classes and tennis courts. Some residents rarely go out except to shop or visit restaurants in the commercial centre of Alphaville.\n\nFigueiredo’s 22-year-old daughter, Fabiana, spent most of her formative years in Alphaville. She recognises that it was a privileged bubble, but wants to move back in after spending several years at university in São Paulo.\n\nFor her, the walls unite as well as divide. In São Paulo, she lives in an apartment block and triple-locks her door. As a result, she has no idea who lives next door.\n\n“In Alphaville, you can at least talk to your neighbour, and we also have a club, a pool, a barbecue area. It’s a life of privilege,” she admits. “Brazil is not safe. If you can afford to come to a place like this, then you come.”\n\nHer mother concurs. “If I were to wake up one morning and find the wall was suddenly gone, my life would totally change. I’d be unhappy and worried because I’d lose the peace of mind that comes from knowing my children can come and go safely. I think I’d look for another compound.”, marker: TRUE"

At 5pm, he is checked out again and makes his way home, across a motorway overpass and up the steep hill to Imperial, a poor area.\n\nAlphaville does not permit favelas (slums) to spring up near its boundaries, but the residents of Imperial live in similar conditions to those in the shantytowns of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Though they overlook and – in the case of Cunha and other staff – help to maintain the manicured lawns and immaculate drives of the gated blocks, the hillside districts have uneven roads, with rubbish strewn across empty plots and graffiti painted on the flaking, whitewashed walls. The ethnic mix is also totally different, with a lot more black faces and a lot fewer white and Asian ones.\n\n“Alphaville is over there; Alfavela is over here,” jokes Cunha. “The rich are inside; the poor are outside.

But he believes the walls highlight the long-standing problems of a nation that was once organised on the basis of elite families and slaves.\n\n“The first thing these walls say is: the government failed to provide security for all of society, so a small percentage provide security for themselves, because violence is one of the major problems in Brazil,” he says. “Secondly, they remind us of income inequality. This is a horrible legacy of Brazil in the 20th century and earlier.” \n\nDe Oliveira says he has never adapted to the culture and mindset of Alphaville. “It’s a place that distances residents from reality. My own parents call the place the Truman Show.”\n\n"

              "$t": "content: “Something there is,” runs a line from Robert Frost’s poem Mending Wall, “that doesn’t love a wall.” But for as long as mankind has been building, we have been building walls: around cities, along borders, across disputed lands; to protect, keep out, demarcate and divide.\n\nJericho, on what is now the West Bank, threw up its city walls as early as 8000BC. The Chinese had built long stretches of their Great Wall by 700BC. Hadrian’s Wall, “to separate the Romans from the Barbarians”, came in AD129.\nIn recent times, France misplaced its faith in a supposedly impregnable barrier the length of its frontier with Germany. Three decades later, concrete and barbed wire was slicing Germany’s former capital in half as well.\n\nThe Maginot Line did not work and the Berlin Wall did not last. But the walls and fences have not stopped going up. Indeed, since the Iron Curtain came down a quarter of a century ago, the world has been busy building separation barriers at a rate perhaps unequalled at any point in history: at least 6,000 miles of wire, concrete, steel, sand, stone, mesh, anything to keep peoples out – or in.\n\nIt is not just walls separating divided communities in cities such as Belfast and Homs, or compounds hermetically sealed to divide rich from poor in metropolises such as Sao Paulo. The vast majority of the fencing is going up on borders – and not just around dictatorships or pariah states.\n\nMost strikingly, some of the world’s major democracies including the US, Israel and India have, in the past decade, built thousands of miles of new barriers along borders both recognised and disputed.\n\nSince 2006, the United States has erected 600 miles of fence – some theoretically unscalable, some “virtual”, relying on sensors and cameras – along its border with Mexico. Israel is building a 400-mile barrier around the West Bank, plus another 165-mile fence along its border with Egypt.\n\nIndia has built a 340-mile barrier along the so-called Line of Control of its disputed border with Pakistan, and is busily constructing another 2,500-mile fence on its frontier with Bangladesh. And last year, Greece threw up a four-metre-high wall along its kilometre-long land border with Turkey. The river Evros runs along much of the land frontier.\n\nWhat is odd is that this building is happening at a time when less physical walls appear to be crumbling. This is the age of the global economy, multinationals, vanishing trade barriers; of “the free movement of goods, capital, services and people”, unprecedented mobility and instantaneous communication.\n\nSo why build new walls at such a moment – especially when, as history shows, the old ones rarely did what they set out to do? For there is almost always a way through, under, over or round a wall: as Janet Napolitano, until recently US secretary of homeland security, once astutely observed: “Show me a 50-foot wall, and I’ll show you a 51-foot ladder.”\n\nJames Anderson, emeritus professor of political geography at Queen’s University Belfast, notes that walls get built for very different reasons. “There are those built as a response to internal civil, often ethno-national, conflict, within states and often within cities,” he says.\n\n“There are those erected because two groups are going at each other, but the state itself is not at stake – rich against poor, white against black, criminal against potential victim. And there are those that run along state borders.”\n\nJustified more often than not, these days, as essential anti-terrorist measures, border fences are more likely to be aimed “at keeping out, or at least differentiating, migrant labour”, argues Anderson. He distinguishes, too, between walls that have arisen from what he calls “the bottom up”, and those imposed from the top down.\n\nBelfast’s walls, he notes, originated in 1969 as “simple defence mechanisms, barricades made of bedsteads and doors to stop vehicles coming in to your street”.\n\nThirty years on, they have become “part of people’s reality” and are still – perhaps uniquely in the world of walls – supported by almost all those who live beside them. Running for the most part parallel to the roads into the city centre, though, they are not “huge impediments” to day-to-day life.\n\nThe barrier separating Israel and the West Bank is different. “This was a state project,” says Anderson. “Certainly some, especially the settler movement, welcome it as protection, security against the suicide bombers. Palestinians see it as a mechanism for a land grab.” At times it also causes almost unimaginable inconvenience and hardship.  \n\nWhatever their intended purpose, walls can have unforeseen consequences, says Mick Dumper, professor in Middle East politics at Exeter University. “Israel built the separation barrier to separate two communities and prevent terrorism,” he says.\n\n“One result has been that 60,000-70,000 Palestinians who had moved out of Jerusalem have moved back, because they didn’t want to be cut off from the services they need: at a time when Israel is seeking to assert the city’s Jewish identity, its Palestinian population has sharply increased.”\n\nAnd a wall changes a city, even after it has come down. Wendy Pullan, senior lecturer in the history and philosophy of architecture at Cambridge University, calls this a “disruption of urban order. A divided city changes its whole metabolism. And divided cities do not flourish.”\n\nThe physical reorganisation and reorientation engendered by a wall is accompanied by an inevitable impact on the psychology of those who live beside it, adds Pullan, who heads the Conflict in Cities (CinC) project run by Cambridge University’s centre for urban conflicts research: “There’s a tendency to vilify those on the other side. It’s very easy to say: we can’t see them, we don’t know them, so we don’t like them.”  \n\nBut mainly, walls just don’t do their job very well. “We don’t have examples of walls solving problems,” says Pullan. Suicide bombings may have fallen dramatically since Israel built its wall, “but it’s hard to say whether that’s cause or correlation. The regime has also got much firmer, in other ways.”\nAnderson, also a member of the CinC team, argues that national border fences are at least partly intended for show, for domestic consumption: they are about governments being seen to do something. If the US were truly serious about tackling illegal migrant labour, he says, “it would prosecute more employers”.  \n\nSo in general, concludes Pullan, walls are “more symbolic than anything else. But their symbolism is enormous. Even now, Berlin remains best known for the wall. The most recognisable image of Jerusalem is now, arguably, its wall. The visual impact is so very strong. If you want to get across the idea of division, a wall is very, very powerful.”\n"

I had Moroccan friends whom I used to hang out with after school, and you could cross back and forth between the two places really easily. Even though many Moroccans worked here without the right paperwork, it wasn’t as bad as the situation now, because they could go back home to their families each night with the money they had earned on the black market.\n\n>When the border fence went up, things really changed, and the problems started. Many of those who worked in Melilla without any paperwork decided to stay here, because it would be impossible for them to cross back after work. This is why we have so many thousands of Moroccans now here illegally, and why the ghettoes have started to grow.

I had Moroccan friends whom I used to hang out with after school, and you could cross back and forth between the two places really easily. Even though many Moroccans worked here without the right paperwork, it wasn’t as bad as the situation now, because they could go back home to their families each night with the money they had earned on the black market.\n\n>When the border fence went up, things really changed, and the problems started. Many of those who worked in Melilla without any paperwork decided to stay here, because it would be impossible for them to cross back after work. This is why we have so many thousands of Moroccans now here illegally, and why the ghettoes have started to grow.
