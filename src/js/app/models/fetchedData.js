Their friends don’t come to visit them; people are scared because we live in a military zone, they can be stopped and asked for IDs.

If all of a sudden there were no threats and everything was totally peaceful, that would be strange.” \n\nWhile North Korea’s sabre-rattling doesn’t scare Lee much, the political theatre on the peninsula does have real effects on life in Tongil Village. Earlier this year, when inter-Korean tensions spiked and North Korea cut off access to the jointly operated Kaesong industrial complex, Lee was locked out of his land for three days. In 2010, after an artillery exchange on Yeonpyeong island left four South Koreans dead, Lee was denied entrance for 15 days. All his dogs and chickens starved to death in that time.\n\nWhile there is some apprehension over the possibility of conflict, Tongil Village also has unique benefits. Unlike almost everywhere else in South Korea, there is no industry here and few cars. Strict rules mean there has been only minimal development; the land is mostly untouched and the air is clean. Villagers drink untreated water, which they draw from aquifers, and gleaming white cranes gather at every body of water. \n\nLee sometimes wishes he could sell his land and farm somewhere more predictable. But with poor inter-Korean relations, the possibility of conflict scares away potential buyers and pushes down land values, so he knows he would not get much if he did sell his land. “It’s my responsibility to maintain this so I don’t have much choice,” says Lee, crouched down while pulling weeds. “I just hope the politics can stay calm so we can keep up with our work.” \n\n• Steven Borowiec, Seoul\n\n",

For all its proximity, however, Oh had no contact with the forbidden south.  The separation was policed more through fear than physical barriers. He remembers a story his father told when he was young: \n\n“Once, when he was a soldier, my father crossed the border by mistake. He was fishing in the Rimjingang and became so engrossed that he actually went a few metres into South Korea.” \n\nThe Rimjingang is a river that traverses the demilitarised zone, flowing into South Korea from the north. Oh’s father noticed that he had strayed too far and immediately turned round, terrified that he would be caught. \n\nOh’s first contact with the south was also unintended. \n\n“I was tuning the television and I found a programme from Seoul by accident. I watched it a few times, with the sound turned very low,” he says. \n\nHe didn’t know at the time that the punishment could be fatal if he was reported. But he knew to tell no one – not even his family.\nSomething about the show intrigued Oh and set in motion his decision to defect. \n\n“I had to go,” he says. “I hoped my sister would come with me but I was scared to talk about it. \n\nOnce I said, ‘Sister, should we try to go to China?’ But her answer was, ‘Are you crazy? How dare you think of it?’ So I had to go alone.” \n\nRather than making the short journey south across the demilitarised zone, Oh had to travel all the way to the north, to the border with China. He sold his father’s army uniform to make money for the journey. \n\n“That was 10 years ago, and I made it out, but I haven’t seen my family since,” says Oh, who now lives in Seoul. Recently he tried to contact his sister through a broker who takes messages from defectors in South Korea to their relatives in the north. \n\n“It took a while,” he says, “and when I finally heard back I was thrilled, but I was also suspicious that she might be in the hands of the security police. \n\n“The broker said her message was: ‘Please come back here so we can live together. The government would forgive you everything.’ But I could not trust what she said.” \n\n• Daily NK reporter, Seoul",

        "content": "<p class=\"byline\">Jon Henley</p>\n\n“Something there is,” runs a line from Robert Frost’s poem Mending Wall, “that doesn’t love a wall.” But for as long as mankind has been building, we have been building walls: around cities, along borders, across disputed lands; to protect, keep out, demarcate and divide.\n\nJericho, on what is now the West Bank, threw up its city walls as early as 8000BC. The Chinese had built long stretches of their Great Wall by 700BC. Hadrian’s Wall, “to separate the Romans from the Barbarians”, came in AD129.\nIn recent times, France misplaced its faith in a supposedly impregnable barrier the length of its frontier with Germany. Three decades later, concrete and barbed wire was slicing Germany’s former capital in half as well.\n\nThe Maginot Line did not work and the Berlin Wall did not last. But the walls and fences have not stopped going up. Indeed, since the Iron Curtain came down a quarter of a century ago, the world has been busy building separation barriers at a rate perhaps unequalled at any point in history: at least 6,000 miles of wire, concrete, steel, sand, stone, mesh, anything to keep peoples out – or in.\n\n##Frontier society\n\nIt is not just walls separating divided communities in cities such as Belfast and Homs, or compounds hermetically sealed to divide rich from poor in metropolises such as Sao Paulo. The vast majority of the fencing is going up on borders – and not just around dictatorships or pariah states.\n\nMost strikingly, some of the world’s major democracies including the US, Israel and India have, in the past decade, built thousands of miles of new barriers along borders both recognised and disputed.\n\nSince 2006, the United States has erected 600 miles of fence – some theoretically unscalable, some “virtual”, relying on sensors and cameras – along its border with Mexico. Israel is building a 400-mile barrier around the West Bank, plus another 165-mile fence along its border with Egypt.\n\nIndia has built a 340-mile barrier along the so-called Line of Control of its disputed border with Pakistan, and is busily constructing another 2,500-mile fence on its frontier with Bangladesh. And last year, Greece threw up a four-metre-high wall along its kilometre-long land border with Turkey. The river Evros runs along much of the land frontier.\n\n##Cable ties\n\nWhat is odd is that this building is happening at a time when less physical walls appear to be crumbling. This is the age of the global economy, multinationals, vanishing trade barriers; of “the free movement of goods, capital, services and people”, unprecedented mobility and instantaneous communication.\n\nSo why build new walls at such a moment – especially when, as history shows, the old ones rarely did what they set out to do? For there is almost always a way through, under, over or round a wall: as Janet Napolitano, until recently US secretary of homeland security, once astutely observed: “Show me a 50-foot wall, and I’ll show you a 51-foot ladder.”\n\nJames Anderson, emeritus professor of political geography at Queen’s University Belfast, notes that walls get built for very different reasons. “There are those built as a response to internal civil, often ethno-national, conflict, within states and often within cities,” he says.\n\n“There are those erected because two groups are going at each other, but the state itself is not at stake – rich against poor, white against black, criminal against potential victim. And there are those that run along state borders.”\n\nJustified more often than not, these days, as essential anti-terrorist measures, border fences are more likely to be aimed “at keeping out, or at least differentiating, migrant labour”, argues Anderson. He distinguishes, too, between walls that have arisen from what he calls “the bottom up”, and those imposed from the top down.\n\n##Obscured perspectives\n\nWhatever their intended purpose, walls can have unforeseen consequences, says Mick Dumper, professor in Middle East politics at Exeter University. “Israel built the separation barrier to separate two communities and prevent terrorism,” he says.\n\n“One result has been that 60,000-70,000 Palestinians who had moved out of Jerusalem have moved back, because they didn’t want to be cut off from the services they need: at a time when Israel is seeking to assert the city’s Jewish identity, its Palestinian population has sharply increased.”\n\nAnd a wall changes a city, even after it has come down. Wendy Pullan, senior lecturer in the history and philosophy of architecture at Cambridge University, calls this a “disruption of urban order. A divided city changes its whole metabolism. And divided cities do not flourish.”\n\nWalls are “more symbolic than anything else,\" she adds. \"But their symbolism is enormous. Even now, Berlin remains best known for the wall. The most recognisable image of Jerusalem is now, arguably, its wall. The visual impact is so very strong. If you want to get across the idea of division, a wall is very, very powerful.”",

When people visit, they always \nask to be taken to see it, but it’s not a tourist attraction. “Where’s the fence,” they ask. “La valla [the fence]” is now part of our vocabulary, which is a terrible thing.\n\n>In our house, because the border is so close, we often hear the screams and shouts of people as they are attacked by the police when they try to climb over at night. And we often find people hiding in our garden. When I was younger I used to get very scared, but now I realise that most of the time, they are much more scared than you are. We have a well, and I have found young men down there too, but when you talk to them they don’t want help at first, because they are so terrified.\n\n>Everyone has their own story. One time I met a young woman, which is rare, and she told me she did not know what had happened to her baby. I didn’t want to judge her, but I wondered what kind of a mother would make such a dangerous journey with a baby. But I learned that she had been raped on her journey from her home to Spain, resulting in the baby.\n\n>My mother and I try to help as often as we can, giving them clothes, and taking them to the police station, where they register themselves for expulsion. One of the ironies for the sub-Saharan Africans is that in order to stay, they have to register themselves for expulsion, so they can start the paperwork. So we put them in the boot of the car, cover them up, and take them there. \n\n>The border has also had an effect on my family. My sister and my nephews live in Rabat in Morocco, which means I hardly ever get to see them. They need a visa to get over here, but because my nephews are minors, that’s not so easy. And the last time I went to Morocco, I got caught up in a huge avalanche of people at the border, and the police started hitting me. I asked them to stop, but they carried on hitting me like everyone else. So now I don’t go – they’re only 12km [7.5 miles] away, but they might as well be on a different continent. \n\n>I would love to be the kind of aunt who is always around, but I won’t get to see them grow up.",

It was common for both Moroccan and Spaniards to cross and return to their respective homes, making it hard to tell exactly where one country ended and the other began.\n\nBut, as mass immigration from west Africa into Europe took off, calls for a more permanent physical barrier led to the development of the fence that today stands more than six metres tall, with hi-tech sensors, razor wire and 24-hour armed patrol guards. The same situation applies in Spain’s other north African exclave, Ceuta. This is where Fortress Europe meets north Africa.\n",

I want to get a white-collar job and use the knowledge I learn to take back to Cameroon, so I can improve my country economically, socially and politically. There is no work there, but in Europe I am sure I will find work. I left without telling my parents, and hope to be very successful one day.\n\n>We all know about the Gurugu mountains; it is where you come to meet with other Africans who want to cross the border into Spain. We are all brothers here, we don’t care what country you come from. We all have the same goal.\nMy plan is to wait here, until there are enough of us, and then we will go over the border. Some people wait here in the mountains for weeks, months, years. We find whatever food we can, or go and take the leftover meat from restaurants, which we make into a soup or cook with a small fire. Some of the Moroccans treat us like animals, throwing stones at us, and reporting us to the police. Many of us get sick with stomach complaints, because often we only have sugary water to drink, which makes us ill, but we don’t have any medication.\n\n>Every day, when the police come to look for us, we hide in terrible places, under rocks, because there is nothing worse than being caught by the Moroccan police. When they catch you they drive you back to the desert, but that won’t stop us.\n\n>But the torment here in the mountains is much worse than my fear of getting over the wall. This is no way to live. I would rather try my luck getting over the wall and then get to Europe. I cannot go back now. By God’s grace I will get there.",

We are on the front line.\n\n>My daughter left to live in England because she couldn’t stand it. There are 14 in this house, including nine children. We need a permit just to go on our own roof, for “security reasons”, they tell us.\n\n>We are buried alive in a big tomb. It’s inhuman. But we hope the wall will come down one day.

The Chinese had built long stretches of their Great Wall by 700BC. Hadrian’s Wall, “to separate the Romans from the Barbarians”, came in AD129.\nIn recent times, France misplaced its faith in a supposedly impregnable barrier the length of its frontier with Germany. Three decades later, concrete and barbed wire was slicing Germany’s former capital in half as well.\n\nThe Maginot Line did not work and the Berlin Wall did not last. But the walls and fences have not stopped going up. Indeed, since the Iron Curtain came down a quarter of a century ago, the world has been busy building separation barriers at a rate perhaps unequalled at any point in history: at least 6,000 miles of wire, concrete, steel, sand, stone, mesh, anything to keep peoples out – or in.\n\n##Frontier society\n\nIt is not just walls separating divided communities in cities such as Belfast and Homs, or compounds hermetically sealed to divide rich from poor in metropolises such as Sao Paulo. The vast majority of the fencing is going up on borders – and not just around dictatorships or pariah states.\n\nMost strikingly, some of the world’s major democracies including the US, Israel and India have, in the past decade, built thousands of miles of new barriers along borders both recognised and disputed.\n\nSince 2006, the United States has erected 600 miles of fence – some theoretically unscalable, some “virtual”, relying on sensors and cameras – along its border with Mexico. Israel is building a 400-mile barrier around the West Bank, plus another 165-mile fence along its border with Egypt.\n\nIndia has built a 340-mile barrier along the so-called Line of Control of its disputed border with Pakistan, and is busily constructing another 2,500-mile fence on its frontier with Bangladesh. And last year, Greece threw up a four-metre-high wall along its kilometre-long land border with Turkey. The river Evros runs along much of the land frontier.\n\n##Cable ties\n\nWhat is odd is that this building is happening at a time when less physical walls appear to be crumbling. This is the age of the global economy, multinationals, vanishing trade barriers; of “the free movement of goods, capital, services and people”, unprecedented mobility and instantaneous communication.\n\nSo why build new walls at such a moment – especially when, as history shows, the old ones rarely did what they set out to do? For there is almost always a way through, under, over or round a wall: as Janet Napolitano, until recently US secretary of homeland security, once astutely observed: “Show me a 50-foot wall, and I’ll show you a 51-foot ladder.”\n\nJames Anderson, emeritus professor of political geography at Queen’s University Belfast, notes that walls get built for very different reasons. “There are those built as a response to internal civil, often ethno-national, conflict, within states and often within cities,” he says.\n\n“There are those erected because two groups are going at each other, but the state itself is not at stake – rich against poor, white against black, criminal against potential victim. And there are those that run along state borders.”\n\nJustified more often than not, these days, as essential anti-terrorist measures, border fences are more likely to be aimed “at keeping out, or at least differentiating, migrant labour”, argues Anderson. He distinguishes, too, between walls that have arisen from what he calls “the bottom up”, and those imposed from the top down.\n\n##Obscured perspectives\n\nWhatever their intended purpose, walls can have unforeseen consequences, says Mick Dumper, professor in Middle East politics at Exeter University. “Israel built the separation barrier to separate two communities and prevent terrorism,” he says.\n\n“One result has been that 60,000-70,000 Palestinians who had moved out of Jerusalem have moved back, because they didn’t want to be cut off from the services they need: at a time when Israel is seeking to assert the city’s Jewish identity, its Palestinian population has sharply increased.”\n\nAnd a wall changes a city, even after it has come down. Wendy Pullan, senior lecturer in the history and philosophy of architecture at Cambridge University, calls this a “disruption of urban order. A divided city changes its whole metabolism. And divided cities do not flourish.”\n\nWalls are “more symbolic than anything else,\" she adds. \"But their symbolism is enormous. Even now, Berlin remains best known for the wall. The most recognisable image of Jerusalem is now, arguably, its wall. The visual impact is so very strong. If you want to get across the idea of division, a wall is very, very powerful.”"
